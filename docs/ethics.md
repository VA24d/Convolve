# Limitations & Ethics

## Limitations
- Vision extraction can misclassify housing material or assets; manual correction is provided.
- Seed scheme data is curated for demo; real deployment requires official data pipelines.
- Eligibility logic is simplified and may not capture all legal nuances.

## Ethics & Safety
- The system avoids making final eligibility decisions; it provides recommendations with traceable evidence.
- Users can inspect matched schemes and filters before acting.
- No sensitive personal data is stored beyond demo signals; production would require consent and privacy controls.
